            <h1>Mori</h1>

            <p>
                A library for using ClojureScript's Persistent Data
                Structures and supporting API from the comfort of
                vanilla JavaScript.
            </p>

            <h2>Rationale</h2>
            <p>
                JavaScript is a flexible and powerful dynamic
                programming language with a beautiful simple
                associative model at its core. However this design
                comes at the cost of ubiquitous mutablity. Mori
                embraces the simple associative model but leaves
                mutability behind and adds many useful features
                missing from the data structures that JavaScript
                natively provides.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Efficient immutable associative data structures</li>
                <li>Uniform iteration for all types</li>
                <li>Value based equality</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Modern JavaScript engines like V8, JavaScriptCore, and
                SpiderMonkey deliver the performance required to deliver efficient
                peristent data structures without incurring too high a cost.
            </p>

            <h2>Mori is not an island</h2>
            <p>
                Beyond the the core philosophy Mori makes no other
                assumptions about how you might use it. In fact, Mori
                has changed some aspects of the ClojureScript API in
                order to better accomodate usage from JavaScript and
                languages that target JavaScript like
                CoffeeScript. For example, where it makes sense, Mori
                returns regular JavaScript arrays so that you can use
                destructuring syntax where available.
            </p>


            <h2>How to use Mori</h2>
            <p>
                Mori can be used in precisely the same way that
                libraries like Underscore.js are used. Mori of course
                provides not only the same functionality but it
                delivers a rich sets of data structures. In general
                Mori's operators are more general than the ones
                provided by Underscore.js - they work on nearly all
                the native JavaScript types. In those cases where they
                do not work you usually just need to wrap the type
                in <code>mori.prim_seq(...)</code>.
            </p>

            <h1>API</h1>

            <h2>The Collections</h2>
            <p>We refer the mori data structures as the collections.</p>

            <h3>mori.list</h3>
            <p>
                Constructs an immutable list. Lists support efficient
                addition at the head of the list. It's important to
                remember that the cost of operations like
                <code>mori.nth</code> will be linear in the size of
                the list.
            </p>
                
            <h3>mori.vector</h3>
            <p>
                Constructs an immutable vector. Vectors support efficient
                addition at the end. They also support efficient random
                access. You will probaly use <code>mori.vector</code> much
                more often than <code>mori.list</code>
            </p>
            
            <h3>mori.hash_map</h3>
            <p>
                Constructs an immutable hash map. Unlike JavaScript objects
                Mori PersistentHashMap support complex keys. It wise to
                use only immutable values for your keys - numbers, strings or
                a Mori collection.
